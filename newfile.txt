West Bengal police, whose narration of the incident in thread on X is as dramatic as the visuals, have said at least 20 rounds were fired in the face-off before the robbers took flight leaving half their loot behind. One of the accused has been arrested and a search is on for the others.The incident took place on Sunday afternoon when seven masked robbers, armed with pistols, a machine gun and a rifle barged into the prominent jewellery shop. The shocking entry left the shopowners and customers petrified. In a matter of minutes, the robbers had cornered ornaments worth over Rs 4 crore.Their escape would have been easy if not for a coincidence. Mr Mondal, officer-in-charge of a police outpost, was in the neighbourhood for some personal work. He was in plain clothes, but was carrying his service revolver. The police officer noticed frenetic movements near the jewellery shop, the frightened faces of the people in the area and smelled a rat.Mr Mondal took position behind an electric pole next to the shop and unlocked his revolver. Around this time, one of the robbers, who was keeping guard outside the shop, spotted him, alerted the others and opened fire. For the next 30-odd seconds, the police officer braved a volley of bullets from the robbers, firing back and taking cover behind the pole. One of his bullets hit a robber and he collapsed to the ground, injured. By now, the other robbers joined the shooting.PromotedListen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.comMr Mondal held his ground, fearlessly returning the robbers' fire.
